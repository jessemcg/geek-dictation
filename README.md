# geek-dictation
Inspired by [nerd-dictation](https://github.com/ideasman42/nerd-dictation), this is a hackable way to implement voice typing on linux. Instead of python, this implementation uses a set of bash scripts. It uses one of Open AI's [Whisper models](https://github.com/openai/whisper) that has been converted and optimized with [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp). The model is run in server mode, then utilized with a curl command that sends it audio recorded with [pw-cat](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-pw-cat/) (pipewire) using hotkeys programmed with [ckb-next](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next). The text is pasted using [ydotool](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool) after it has been processed with custom SED commands (all in memory). A similar approach is [voice_typing](https://github.com/themanyone/voice_typing). The advantage with geek-dictation is speed, customization (with the SED commands), and the ability to pause as long as you want while recording your audio.

Note: [pw-cat/pw-record](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-pw-cat/) is the key to making this work. The second script triggered by releasing the hotkey kills pw-rec and begins sending the resulting wave file to the Whisper model. Doing this with other recording options in linux, such as sox, results in deleting about two seconds from the end of the audio file. This can be fixed by adding a two-second delay in the script, but that defeats the goal of making the entire process fast. When pw-rec is killed, the entire audio file remains intact. I think this has something to do with pw-rec's lower latency recording.

Note: Two different sets of SED commands are used in this example (one for the main text and one for the citations). Each is tied to a different key.

## Dependencies
* whisper.cpp
* ffmpeg (might already be installed)
* wl-clipboard
* ckb-next
* a keyboard or mouse compatible with ckb-next
* pw-cat/pw-rec (likely already installed)
* curl (likely installed already)

## Getting Started
### Set up a GGML optimized whisper model
The documentation in [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) is fairly straight forward. If using a Cuda enabled Nvidia GPU, I recommend the largest model. If using a CPU for inference, I recommend the English small model or the English base model.

#### Compiling for Cuda Enabled GPU

The whisper.cpp documentation describes ways to further accelerate inference speed. If at all possible, I highly recommend compiling for use with a Cuda enabled Nvidia GPU. This will allow you to run the largest whisper model with near-instant speech to text translation. The above example was done with an RTX 4090.

You will need the Cuda toolkit installed. On Ubuntu:

	sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

#### Compiling with Openvino for CPU inference

For CPU inference, you can use [openvino](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino). Openvino is an Intel project, but it works just fine with AMD CPUs with an x86 architecture. 
    
#### Optionally Use Whisperfile
You can also download a ready-to-go executible from [whiperfile](https://github.com/cjpais/whisperfile), which is based on the work of Mozilla and [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile). They have found a way to "collapses all the complexity of LLMs down to a single-file," and it works on almost any computer.

The performance is probably not quite as good as if you compiled whisper.cpp yourself. When I tested whisperfile with openivo on the CPU, there was about a 30% decrease in speed. One option could be to start using geek-dictation with whisperfile, then if you want that little bit of extra speed, compile your own executible with [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) and openvino.

### Install ffmpeg if not already installed
ffmpeg is used to convert the recorded audio to a whisper compatible audio file (when starting the server, the -convert flag does this). Although the "record.sh" script uses pw-rec to record a wave file, the whisper model uses a very specific type of wave file.
	
Ubuntu:

	sudo apt install ffmpeg

### Install wl-clipboard

Ubuntu:

	sudo apt install wl-clipboard

### Get ydotool working

You will need an application that can simulate the keyboard function for pasting the contents of the clipboard into something that is not just a terminal (control+c). I have found that [ydotool](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool) works best for this. Like other projects, I used to use a keyboard simulation app to type all of the converted text. However, because geek-dictation processes all of an audio file at once, it is possible and faster to just paste the converted text into the word processor.

To install [ydotool](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool) on Wayland, follow these steps:

1. Get dependencies for building project

	sudo apt install git cmake g++ libevdev-dev libudev-dev
	
2. Download and build project

	git clone https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool.git
	cd ydotool
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DBUILD_MANPAGES=OFF ..
	make -j$(nproc)
	sudo make install

3. Create a udev rule to write to input directory. Open and modify relevent file:

	sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ydotool.rules
	
Paste the following into that file:

	KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="input", MODE="0660"

4. Reload udev:

	sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
	sudo udevadm trigger

5. Add your user to input group:

	sudo usermod -aG input <your_user_name>
	
6. Reboot

7. Create user systemd service to make changes permanent

	mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
	gedit ~/.config/systemd/user/ydotoold.service
	
Paste the following into that file:

	[Unit]
	Description=ydotool Daemon (User)
	# Run after the user session/graphical environment is available
	After=graphical-session-pre.target
	Wants=graphical-session-pre.target

	[Service]
	Type=simple
	ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ydotoold
	Restart=on-failure
	RestartSec=5

	# Often needed for user services on Wayland to find the right runtime dir
	Environment=DISPLAY=:0
	Environment=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/%U
	# If you have a standard D-Bus session bus:
	Environment=DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/%U/bus
	# Some systems define WAYLAND_DISPLAY instead of DISPLAY, so you might need:
	# Environment=WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0

	[Install]
	WantedBy=default.target
	
8. Enable and start the user service

	systemctl --user daemon-reload
	
	systemctl --user enable --now ydotoold
	
9. Check status and test

	systemctl --user status ydotoold
	
	ydotool type "Hello from Wayland!"
	
If it types the text somewhere (e.g., in your terminal), youâ€™ve confirmed it works on your Wayland setup.

### Ubuntu Permissions Issue

On Ubuntu, users do not have default write permissions for the /dev/shm directory, which stores temporary files in memory. To allow permission, edit this file:

	sudo gedit /etc/fstab
	
Paste this line at the bottom, save, and reboot:

	tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,exec,inode64 0 0
	
### Place Geek-Dictation in Home folder
All of these instructions assume that geek-dictation scripts are in your home folder. For a quick way to so this:

	git clone https://github.com/jessemcg/geek-dictation.git
	
Make sure the scripts are executable.

	sudo chmod +x /$HOME/geek-dictation/*.sh

### Program hotkeys with ckb-next
Install [ckb-next](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next), which is a GUI based app that allows the user to assign functionality to keys or buttons on supported Corsair keyboards or mice.
	
Ubuntu:

	sudo apt install ckb-next
	
* Open ckb-next. Navigate to your keyboard and click on a key to use for general voicetyping. With the "Binding" dialogue open, choose the "Program" sub dialogue. Then type in the command for executing the "record.sh" script for the "on key press" option. Make sure the "Single release" option is unchecked. Then type in the command for executing the "process.sh" script for the "on key release" option. Make sure the "Single release" option is checked.

* For in-line voicetyping (like to edit just a few words), choose a different hotkey and follow the same steps. But for the "on key release" option, type in the command for executing the "process_quick_edit.sh" script. This ensures that the first word is not capitalized, and that there is no punctuation at the end.

### Create custom SED commands
Add SED commands to the sed_commands.txt file to make any changes to spelling, grammer, style, etc. To determine whether a SED command is working as intended, you can uncomment the last line in the "process.sh" file and inspect the original whisper output in the resulting log file. Just compare that to the modified output. When creating SED commands, make sure you backslash symbols that could have meaning as bash code or regular expressions unless you intend for that regular expression to be operative. Consult GPT-4 for assistance.

### Optionally use an app or extenstion to launch the frequently used scripts not assigned to hotkeys
You can start and stop the whisper.cpp server with:

Start Server

	bash /$HOME/geek-dictation/start_server.sh
	
Stop Server
	
	bash /$HOME/geek-dictation/stop_server.sh

However, if you use geek-dictation daily, you may want to use a script launching app to start the Whisper.cpp server, to stop the server, and to edit the sed_commands.txt file. For gnome, the [Launcher](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5874/launcher/) extension is a good option.
