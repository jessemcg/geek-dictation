 12 years went by and then after several years more a man sat on his chair and went on his
 porch and dropped a bug into his coffee.
 Why did this sentence not continue? I don't get it.
 Anyway, 50 years later, he got sugar and dropped a bug into his coffee.
 Okay, this should just be logging the portion where it just combines all of the different lines so there's no separate lines.
 Okay, now this is the real test. Fifty years ago, he went outside, went to the grocery store, and then chopped a bug into his coffee.
 Okay, now I need to do a run-on sentence. There was a bug that lived in the bottom of the sea. And he was unhappy, so he went to the surface and had a big party.
 Okay, now I'm just doing the curl output.
 So I need to do another long run-on sentence and to keep it going.
 There's a log and a frog and a hole in the bottom of the sea.
 Okay, so I was sitting at the signpost and I saw far off in the distance
 and then I took my book and I read a story about a frog that would not get off the log.
 This is a test to see if it is working.

 This is an example of a run-on sentence that goes on and on and talks about frogs and logs.
 And the frog's mother did not want to see the frog.
